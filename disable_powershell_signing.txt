To check your current execution policy, you can run Get-ExecutionPolicy. But you're probably here because you want to change it.

To do so you'll run the Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet.

You'll have two major decisions to make when updating the execution policy.

Execution Policy Type:
Restricted† - No Script either local, remote or downloaded can be executed on the system.
AllSigned - All script that are ran require to be digitally signed.
RemoteSigned - All remote scripts (UNC) or downloaded need to be signed.
Unrestricted - No signature for any type of script is required.
Scope of new Change
LocalMachine† - The execution policy affects all users of the computer.
CurrentUser - The execution policy affects only the current user.
Process - The execution policy affects only the current Windows PowerShell process.
† = Default

For example: if you wanted to change the policy to RemoteSigned for just the CurrentUser, you'd run the following command:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
